# Adhesive Jotting

## What is it

Create sticky notes with others online in real time, vote on them!

Some features that I like

* When another user is moving a card it is highlighted and you cannot move the card
* There's a secret admin pannel!

## How to run it

Assuming you already have yarn installed

* Install deps `yarn`
* Start the server `yarn run server`
* Start the client (in a second terminal) `yarn run start` (or build and deploy a prod build `yarn build`)

## Why make this when there are so many alternatives

Too few that were self hostable and open source that had the features that I wanted

I enjoy learning :)
